18. Understanding the role of AppModule & Component Declaration

What is AppModule?

* Angular uses components to build web pages.
* Angular uses modules to bundle different pieces into packages.
* For lot of projects, AppModule is enough.
* For bigger projects,  splitting app into multiple app modules.
* 'AppModule' uses a decorator called '@NgModule'.
* '@NgModule' is imported from '@angular/core'.
* '@NgModule' is has below properties:
	- declarations
	- imports
	- providers
	- bootstrap
* If we don't configuer our new components, Angular doesn't know about our new components.
* So we have to register our new components in the @NgModule.
* We have to give entry of our new components in the 'declarations' section of '@NgModule' decorator.

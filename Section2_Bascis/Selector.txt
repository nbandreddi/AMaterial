Selector:
=========

The CSS selector that identifies this directive in a template and triggers instantiation of the directive.

Declare as one of the following:

element-name: Select by element name.
.class: Select by class name.
[attribute]: Select by attribute name.
[attribute=value]: Select by attribute name and value.
:not(sub_selector): Select only if the element does not match the sub_selector.
selector1, selector2: Select if either selector1 or selector2 matches.

Angular only allows directives to apply on CSS selectors that do not cross element boundaries.

For the following template HTML, a directive with an input[type=text] selector, would be instantiated only on the <input type="text"> element.

<form>
  <input type="text">
  <input type="radio">
<form>

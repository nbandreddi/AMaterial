Component:
==========

* Decorator that marks a class as an Angular component and provides configuration metadata that determines how the component should be processed, instantiated, and used at runtime.

* Components are the most basic UI building block of an Angular app. An Angular app contains a tree of Angular components.

* Angular components are a subset of directives, always associated with a template. Unlike other directives, only one component can be instantiated for a given element in a template.

* A component must belong to an NgModule in order for it to be available to another component or application. To make it a member of an 'NgModule', list it in the 'declarations' field of the 'NgModule' metadata.


* Component decorator provides below configuration metadata.

	- selector
	- templateUrl / template
	- styleUrls / styles

})

  title = 'first-assignment';
}

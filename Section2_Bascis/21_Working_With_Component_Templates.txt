21. Working with Component Templates

* We have seen that we are putting template in HTML file like 'server.component.html' / 'servers.component.html'.
* Instead of using the external template file, we could also use inline template. It means defining HTML code in the TS code.
We could do this by goint to 'server.component.ts' / servers.component.ts' files.
* In the '@Component' decorator, one of the properties either templateUrl or template must be there.
template 	- we use this for providing inline template
templateUrl - we use this for providing external template.
* If we have more than 3 lines of code in the 'template', it's preffered to use 'templateUrl'. It means using external file is a good idea. If we use external file it's easier to follow & easier to understand.

Note: 
* In '@Component' decorator, we could omit 'selector' & 'styleUrls'. But we could not omit 'template'/'templateUrl'.
* Either 'template' or 'templateUrl' is mandatory.

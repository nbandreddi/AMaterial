25. What is Databinding ?

* Databinding = Communication
* Communication between TypeScript code (Business logic) & Template (HTML)
* Business logic like fetch something from server finishing the calculations & displays that to user. Only thing user sees is template.
* We need some kind of communication between both the pieces, 
	i) TS code (Business logic) 
	ii) Template (HTML)
 to really do something in our app. That is where databinding comes into the picture because it is responsible for this communication.
* If we want to output the data from TS code to HTML code. We could use below.
	i) String Interpolation ( {{data}} )
	ii) Property Binding ( [property] = "data" )
	
	TypeScript code (Business logic)    ------- Output Data --------->    Template (HTML)
	
* We know that template is the thing that user sees & also able to interact with template by typing the data, by clicking buttons.
* For example, when user clicks a button, wants to trigger something in  the TS code.

	TypeScript code (Business logic)    <------- React to (user) events ---------    Template (HTML)
	
* We could react to the User events with Event Binding ( (event) = "expression" )

* We have an additional form of Databinding where we combine both the directions that is Two-way-Binding ( [(ngModel)] = "data" ). 
Here we are able to react to events & output something at the same time.

16. Components are Important !

* Angular in the end is a JS Framework, changing your DOM ('HTML') at runtime.
* Component is one of the very important features of Angular.
* A web page could have multiple components. Lets say.
	- Header (as component)
		* It could have multiple other components like 'Home' button as one component, 'Users' as another component.
	- Main area (as component)
	- Side bar (as component)
* Core idea of Angular is to build various components.
* Each component has its own
	- Template
	- It's own HTML code
	- It's own styling
	- It's own business logic
	
* Component allows us to split up a complex application (or)  web page into reusable parts that allows us to replicate the business logic.
* Instead of putting entire code into one single script file or one single HTMl file, it's very easy to update , very easy to exchange  and again reusable.
